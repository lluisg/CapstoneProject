But anyways, nothing speical has been going on except I got a 100 on my math test! WOO! You don't now how exciting that is... well... megan does because math for me is biology for megan. Me and megan are two of a kind... or not.  Guys, I think there's something wrong with me. I can't stop sleeping! At first I was like oh it's because i've been staying up late and getting up early in the morning. But for about 3-4 weeks i've been going to bed around 10-10:30 and than I get up around 6. The thing is... I come home and take a 2-3 hour nap! It's crazy... I mean if it wasn't EVERY day I wouldn't be so worried. And than... even when i take naps i'm already tired by 8! I dont' know... maybe i'm going through a growth spurt or something... i hope not!  So, i'm trying to think about what's going on in my life. Alias and charmed have started up again and i'm SOOO happy. I have re-instated my regular sunday nights and Jennifer's couch, eating good food and wonderful ice cream.   Yes  urlLink Megan ... Zero (from holes) IS a cuttie.... woo and that last scene... yowsers... hahah.  Today, we didn't have school which lucky me.... I was sick. I missed Jennifer's party! Ahh, i feel so bad about that. But than my mom dragged me shopping and I was like all blotchy and hideous... ew. I ended up getting a lot of stuff though which i'm happy about! I rock... haha... yeah. Wow, life is okay again... I'd like to thank God for that.   \"The worst moment for the atheist is when he is really thankful and has nobody to thank.\" Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828 - 1882)  \n",

To do this, we will use the previously defined max size (the length of the word supercalifragilisticexpialidocious) as the fixed size for our words and then pad short words with the category 'no letter' (which we will label 0) and truncate long words.\n",

However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code (the predict file). For the rest of the files, we can copy the ones from the source directory to the serve directory and provide them to the SageMaker inference container to deploy a Pytorch model.\n",
